			<p>
				Born in the United Kingdom in 1963 and started programming at the age of 14. I started my professional career at the age of
				20 (1983), working for Chemical Bank in Cardiff. In 1986 I moved to London and worked in retail (Harrods), and the betting
				industry (William Hill), before moving to manufacturing in Bristol. After a few years I started working in the
				telecomunications industry, moving back to London working with high-capacity IVR systems (Ladbrokes Racing).

				In 1994 I moved to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) working as a consoltant helping to setup a company specialising in IVR and call
				center solutions.

				I moved back to th UK in 1997 to work with Rockwell-Collins (Avionics), but in 1998 had the opportunity to move back to
				Malaysia and start a company specialising in premium-rate IVR systems. In 2001 I moved to Montreal (Canada) to work on a new
				form of AI (utilising genetic algorithms), returning to Malaysia in 2002 on a 2 year contract with Advanced BusinessLink as
				head of R & D. I then worked for several marketing companies as technology head until 1997 when I partnered with some
				like-minded people to start Dragonsoft Research. After a buy-out of Dragonsoft in 2019 I started working for Wiseyes
				Solutions as their Chief Technology Innovations Officer.

				In July 2022 I joined Manyfold Pte Ltd as CTO. Manyfold is a startup focussed on NFT rental. My responsibilities include
				management of an outsourced project team (based in Vietnam) to deliver our primary web and mobile applications. Development
				and deployment of blockchain smart contracts for the rental application, and AMM/Treasury contracts for the tokenomics. I
				also developed a NFT player application for Android TV as a complimentary product, integrating with the rental applications
				to provide a managed display environment for NFTs.
